    <h1>5 Thisns To Know About Poodles</h1><br><br>
    <h2>1. Poodles first originated in Germany, not France.</h2><br>
    <p>Although it is the national dog of France, the Poodle actually originated in Germany. The breed name comes from
        the German word, “pudel” or “pudelin,” which means “to splash in the water.” In fact, the term “French Poodle”
        is a misnomer. In France, the breed is called Caniche, French for “duck dog.”</p>
    <h2>2. They were originally bred as hunting dogs.</h2><br>
    <p>The Poodle was named after splashing in water because these dogs were originally bred to be water retrievers.
        Their job was to bring ducks and other birds back to their masters. They haven’t lost their skills over the
        years. Some waterfowl hunters still use Poodles in the field today.</p>
    <h2>3. The Poodle cut is meant for function, not fashion.</h2><br>
    <p>It might seem like the ultimate canine fashion statement, but the traditional Poodle cut is really all about
        function, not fashion. Less hair would make the Poodle a more efficient swimmer, but more vulnerable to cold
        water. To get the best of both worlds, Poodle owners placed puffs of hair around the joints and the upper torso
        to protect the joints and vital organs.</p>
    <h2>4. They have hair, not fur.</h2><br>
    <p>“What’s the difference between hair and fur?” you may wonder. Fur grows up to a certain point and then falls
        off—what we know as shedding. Hair does not fall out and never stops growing. Poodle hair, like human hair, can
        respond to hormonal changes in the body. Female Poodles can experience hair thinning or loss after having
        puppies.</p>
    <h2>5. Poodles come in three size varieties, but all follow one breed standard.</h2><br>
    <p>From the tiny Toy Poodle to the mid-sized Miniature Poodle and stunning Standard Poodle, the breed comes in
        different sizes. All the sizes fall under the same breed and are expected to comply with the same breed
        standard.</p>
