    <!-- Care Tips -->
    <h1>Top 3 Poodle Care Tips</h1><br><br>
    <h2>Care Tip #1: Offer a high-quality food</h2><br>
    <p>What you feed your Poodle will greatly affect their health, both now and long-term. Far too many commercial
        brands are subpar; they may have chemicals such as artificial coloring, flavoring and preservatives which
        can cause everything from itchy skin to upset stomach. Some are linked to neurological issues and certain
        cancers.
        Far too many dog foods also have fillers which are cheap ingredients that only serve to plump up food
        (making it appear as if there is more than is actually there); these are not absorbed by the body and simply
        get flushed out. These are responsible for making a dog hungry soon after he ate which is linked to
        coprophagia and malnutrition.
        You'll also want to keep away from meat by-products which are animal parts deemed unfit for human
        consumption. These are typically referred to as 4-D animals which stands for diseased, dying, dead, or
        disabled and can be just about any species found as roadkill or sourced from zoos or farms. Body parts that
        are put into dog food as by-products include beaks, hooves, spinal tissue, spleens, and other tissue that
        you would not want your Poodle to be eating.
    </p>
    <h2>Care Tip #2: Proper Exercise</h2><br>
    <p>Making sure that your Poodle receives enough exercise is vital to overall good health and is a step that can
        help increase life span.
        Physically, exercise keeps the heart healthy, works to maintain muscle tone and can reduce the risk of
        developing several diseases including canine diabetes and even some cancers.
        Psychologically, exercise helps a dog release pent-up energy and often leads to better behavior.
        Socially,bringing a dog outside helps them to learn tolerance of outdoor elements which leads to being
        better socialized and accepting of triggers such as other dogs, children, and such things as traffic.
        Poodles, of all varieties, should ideally have two walks per day, lasting from 20 to 30 minutes. Add in a
        daily cardio session; fetch is always a great choice. </p>
    <h2>Care Tip #3: Annual Vet Visits</h2><br>
    <p>Wellness checks are an important part of care. Just like humans should have annual health exams, so should
        our pets. For senior Poodles, twice-per-year geriatric check-ups are needed.
        There is a vast array of health issues that when caught early are exceedingly easier and less costly to
        treat.
        The vet will perform a complete examination of the body, listen to the heart and lungs and screening will be
        done (urinalysis, stool sample, blood tests) to rule out common issues that do occur with dogs.
        These are all important aspects of a checkup that can find issues before a dog is so ill that clinical signs
        are obvious.
